# XOR Encryption and Decryption using Python and C++

This project demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt text using the XOR algorithm in both Python and C++ programming languages.

## XOR Algorithm

XOR encryption is a widely used method of data encryption that involves the use of a special key to perform bitwise operations on the data. It is a form of symmetric encryption, meaning that the same key is used for both encryption and decryption of data. XOR encryption is particularly popular for its simplicity and speed, making it an ideal choice for many applications where secure communication is essential.

## Why We Use Xor Encryption?

XOR algorithm has various use cases in the field of computer science, some of which are:

### Data Security

XOR algorithm can be used to ensure the security of data during transmission or when stored in databases.

### Simple Encryption

XOR algorithm can be used for simple data encryption operations. It is often preferred in situations where the aim is to prevent third parties from reading the data.

### Data Compression

XOR algorithm can be used for data compression operations. It is especially useful in situations where the same values are repeated consecutively, as it helps to reduce the size of the data.

These use cases demonstrate the versatility and importance of the XOR algorithm in various applications.

## Usage

### Python

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the `python` directory.
3. Open the file `XOR_Encryption.py` in your preferred code editor.
4. Use the `encrypt` function to encrypt your desired text by passing the text and a key as arguments. The function will return an encrypted hexadecimal string.
5. Use the `decrypt` function to decrypt the encrypted text by passing the encrypted text and the same key used for encryption as arguments. The function will return the decrypted text as a string.

### C++

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the `cpp` directory.
3. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
4. Run the executable.
5. Follow the prompts to encrypt or decrypt text.

## Release
