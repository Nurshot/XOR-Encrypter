# XOR-Encrypter
Encrypting and decrypting text using XOR algorithm in Python and C++ programming languages.


XOR Encryption and Decryption in Python and C++
This project demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt text using the XOR algorithm in both Python and C++ programming languages.

XOR Algorithm
XOR, short for "Exclusive Or", is a logical operation that applies to two bits or bytes. When two bits are XORed together, the result is 1 only if exactly one of the bits is 1. Otherwise, the result is 0. This operation is commonly used in cryptography and data manipulation.
